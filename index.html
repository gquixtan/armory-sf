			<ul class="text-muted">
				<li>The building was designed with a castle-like appearance in a Moorish Revival style and it was completed in 1914.</li>
				<li>The interior of the building has 200,000 square ft.</li>
				<li>The National Guard occupied the building since 1914 to 1976.</li>
				<li>For most of the past 30 years (1976â€“2006), it sat vacant.</li>
				<li>Several spaceship-interior scenes in the Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back' were filmed there.</li>
				<li>In 1978 the building was registered as a Class 2 historical landmark in the National Register of Historic Places.</li>
				<li>In late 2006, The Armory was purchased for $14.5 million by Kink.com, a San Francisco-based internet pornography producer specializing in BDSM pornography.</li>
			    <li>As of 2007, the company is using the building as a studio for production of content for their websites. Peter Acworth, the company's owner, has stated that the structure suits the needs of the company very well without need for significant structural modifications to the building, and that the company would begin repairs to the decaying structure.</li>
			    <li>In May and December, 2008, the San Francisco Armory hosted Mission Bazaar, an all-ages arts fair featuring local artists and craftspeople selling their work, as well as performances. It was the first public event held in the Armory since the 1970s.</li>
			    <li>Since 2008, the building has housed public events and sports competitions. It is open for public tours and BDSM-related workshops.</li>
			    <li>In January 2017, Kink.com announced that it would cease the use of the Armory for film production.</li>
			    <li>In June of 2017, the Armory opened its doors to host Techtonica, a non-profit that works to "bridge the tech gap" by offering free tech training, living/childcare stipends, and job placement to local women & non-binary femme adults with low incomes.</li>
